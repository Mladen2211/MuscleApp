# MuscleApp Web

Next.js 14 shell application for the MuscleApp monorepo. This project currently exposes only placeholder UI and configuration while backend/product requirements are still being finalized.

## Scripts
- `pnpm dev` – run the local dev server with Next.js Turbo support.
- `pnpm build` – build the production bundle.
- `pnpm start` – serve the built bundle.
- `pnpm lint` – run Next.js/ESLint checks.

Update this package with real pages and components once product direction is defined.
