# MuscleApp Mobile

Expo-managed React Native shell app for the MuscleApp monorepo.

## Scripts
- `pnpm start` – launch Expo dev server (defaults to LAN).
- `pnpm android` / `pnpm ios` – run native builds via Expo.
- `pnpm web` – start Expo for web.

Replace `App.tsx` once product requirements are finalized. Add assets under `apps/mobile/assets` as needed.
